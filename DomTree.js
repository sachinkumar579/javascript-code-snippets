// The backbone of an HTML document is tags. According to the Document Object Model (DOM), every HTML tag is an object All these objects are accessible using JavaScript

// For example, document.body is the object representing the <body> tag. 

// DOM represents HTML as a tree structure of tags.

// the top tag is always <html>. Even if it doesnâ€™t exist in the document, it will exist in the DOM, because the browser will create it.

// The document object that represents the whole document is, formally, a DOM node as well.

// $ ( insert a number).methods()  - get a node from elements in console 

// We can use developer tools to inspect DOM and modify it manually.

// An HTML/XML document is represented inside the browser as the DOM tree.
