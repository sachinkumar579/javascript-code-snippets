// Global object provide variables and functions that are accessible anywhere . By default they are built into the language or the environment

// In a browser it is named window and in nodejs environment it is called global 

// In a browser, global functions and variables declared with var (not let/const!) become the property of the global object: 

// The same effect have function declarations (statements with function keyword in the main code flow, not function expressions).
