// The ultimate goal when we write code should be make it maintainable , readbable and reusable , no matter which programming language is used   
// Design patterns are reusable templates for commonly occurring problems in software design . 
// solutions for repeated problems 

// Creational - how to create objects 
// Structural -  relationships between objects
// Behavior - communication/interaction between objects 

// OOPs concepts
// Encapsulation  - having the variables and methods in a unit called Class and allowing only the Class to update variables using methods . 
// The class can entirely control how the state must be altered 
// Abstraction - hide certain details and show only what is important in the object . 100 % abstraction can be achieved using interfaces . 
// We can include only those which are to be exposed to the caller . The class implementing this interface can have more methods which are not directly exposed to the caller
// Another simple way to achieve abstraction is by making methods private . Ex If there is ConnectServer class ,  we can make initiate() , authenticate() methods
// private and only expose one method called connect by making it public 
//
